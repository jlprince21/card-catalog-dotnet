# Card Catalog Core

Written in C#, this program helps collect file metadata. It is a
reimplementation of the Rust card_catalog project with more capabilities.

Data collected about files include:

1. File name
2. Path
3. Size
4. XxHash checksum
5. Date examined

In addition to collecting file metadata, the program assists in indexing files
with tools such as file tagging, search, and more.

# Getting Started

This application requies .NET 6, dotnet-ef CLI tools, and a PostgreSQL database.

## Environment Variables

CARD_CATALOG_DB_CONNECTION - required, sets the connection string to the
PostgreSQL database that will be used. Example entry in ~/.zshrc on macOS is

`export CARD_CATALOG_DB_CONNECTION="Host=<IP_ADDRESS>;Port=5432;Database=<DATABASE_NAME>;Username=<USERNAME>;Password=<PASSWORD>"`

## Running the Projects

Setup a PostgreSQL database with an empty database that the API will use. Before
running migrations, run this query in the database you want Card Catalog to use
to enable an extension needed for UUID support.

``` SQL
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp";
```

Next, inside the CardCatalog.Api directory run the migrations:

``` bash
dotnet restore
dotnet-ef database update --verbose # remember to install dotnet-ef!
```

Now you can choose to run the web API or terminal programs.

To use the web API, go to the CardCatalog.Api directory and:

``` bash
dotnet restore
dotnet run
```

Scanning files requires using the console application. Go to
CardCatalog.Terminal directory and:

...to hash files:

``` bash
dotnet run --hash <ROOT_DIRECTORY>
```

...to search for and optionally remove files no longer present (orphans):

``` bash
dotnet run --orphans
```

## Docker Reference

Using the Docker Compose file provided with this project currently doesn't run
the migrations. To get started:

1. Review and set the environment variables to your desired values in `docker-compose.yml`.
2. Run this command to start a new database, pgAdmin, and the API.

``` bash
docker-compose up -d # Remove `-d` if you want to see output
```

3. Login to pgAdmin (likely 127.0.0.1:5050). Create a new server registration
   and database. Run the UUID extension enabling query. You will need to get the
   IP address of the database container when creating the server in pgAdmin, use:

``` bash
docker ps
docker inspect <POSTGRESQL_CONTAINER_ID> | grep IPAddress
```

1. Run the migrations manually using the local copy of the project. On macOS
   the connection string will use 127.0.0.1 to connect to the database.

The API should now be running on port 5555. Test it with your favorite HTTP
client!
